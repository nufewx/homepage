Yihan Jin is a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), specializing in intelligent maintenance methods and advanced simulation of machine tools. His research focuses on integrating machine learning architectures, such as CNN and Transformer models, to monitor tool wear and detect faults in real time. Besides, under the guidance of [Professor Nicholas X. Fang](https://www.mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/fang-x), Yihan has also contributed to projects at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), where he developed innovative methods for scan path optimization and 3D model reconstruction using robotic ultrasound imaging.

Throughout his academic career, Yihan has worked on interdisciplinary projects, including rehabilitation evaluation algorithms in collaboration with Ruijin Hospital and simulation optimizations for the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC). He has also co-authored several patents related to electric vehicle chassis optimization and high-precision machine tool deformation measurement. His technical skills span CAD/CAE software, such as Solidworks and Hypermesh, as well as programming languages like Python and MATLAB.
